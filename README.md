# IFD:ISO12006-3

This is implementation of the current and development version of ISO 12006-3 (version 3) and suggestions of some of the changes for the version 4. These changes focuse on interoperability between IFC and IFD in the area of units and reliably encoded values.

There is also a samples project where sample data can be created using both schemas. 

`generator.exe`can be used to update the schema implementation when EXPRESS definitions are changed in the `.exp` file.
